# My Responsive Portfolio

## Description

With this portfolio, I made it a mission for future employers and peers to get a small glimpse of who I am.
I'm just one of over 60 students currently Georgia Tech's Full Time Coding Boot Camp, and I can assure that we are up to our heads with this curriculum, but at the end of the day, we are all people, and with this project, it allowed us to showcase what we have learned so far by allowing us to create a site that showcased our current skills, but also let us ecpress ourselves with the fun pictures we posted and also the information we shared.

This project let us show what we have learned so far during this course, which at the time has only been a week and a half. It's a good measuring stick of where we currently are and it will be fun to come back at the end of the course to show us how far we have come.

## Contents

The following links provided are for my personal GitHub, which will show all my files associated with this work, including this README, and 4 HTML files, and also a CSS file. They will show my process while completing this task by showing all the times i made minor and major changes by Git Push. The second link is of the functioning page itself. It's 3 pages in all, each being linked to each other by cliking on the links. The fourth page is just a "Thank You" to the viewer by clicking on my interactive "submit" button. These pages and files show the hard work I have put in as a Coder who is just beggining, but also scratching the surface.
